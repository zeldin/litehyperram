       A small footprint and configurable HyperRAM core
                  powered by Migen & LiteX

[> Intro
--------
LiteHyperRAM provides a small footprint and configurable HyperRAM core.

[> Features
-----------
PHY:
  - ECP5 1X and 2X DDR PHY
Core:
  - Both memory and register space access supported
  - Arbitrary burst length
Frontend:
  - Native or Wishbone user interface.
  - CSR interface to register space

[> Native interface
-------------------
The native port (LiteHyperRAMNativePort) consists of three endpoints,
cmd, wdata and rdata.  A write access uses cmd and wdata, and a read
access uses cmd and rdata.  Multiple 16-bit words can be transferred
over the wdata/rdata endpoint for a single write or read command (burst
mode).  When the 2X DDR PHY is used, memory transfers use 32-bit words.

cmd:
  - we: Set to 1 for write, 0 for read
  - aspace: Set to 1 for register access, 0 for memory access
  - burst_type: Set to 1 for linear burst, 0 for wrapped/hybrid burst
    (writes to register space must specify linear burst)
  - addr: word address
  - valid: Set to 1 to start a new transaction
  - ready: The command is accepted when both valid and ready are 1

wdata:
  - data: 16-bit word to write (or 32-bit for 2X mode)
  - we: 2-bit (4-bit in 2X mode) signal deciding which byte(s) of data
    to write to memory (ignored on register writes)
  - last: Set to 1 on the last word of the burst to terminate the write
    operation
  - ready: Provide the next word when this is set to 1
  - valid: Not supported!  The client must provide valid data at the
    latest 2 cycles after the command has been accepted, and provide the
    next word of data in the cycle after any cycle where ready is 1 and
    last is 0

rdata:
  - data: 16-bit input word (or 32-bit for 2X mode)
  - last: Set to 1 on the last word of the burst to terminate the read
    operation.  Note that this signal must be driven by the client, since
    the controller does not know how long burst is required.  Due to latencies
    a number of additional reads will be performed after the one with last set
    to 1, but valid will not be indicated for these reads.
  - valid: When this is set to 1 the next input word is available in data
  - ready: Not supported!   The client must accept any word with the valid
    bit set immediately; it will not be retained to subsequent cycles.

Writes to register CR0 must preserve bits 3-7, or the controller will
stop working.
